## Background

Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. In 2017, U.S. fitness centers had a total membership of 60.87 million.

Our motivations include:
- Exercising incorrectly is inefficient and may even cause injuries.
- Tracking user vital sign is important during the exercise.
- Most wearables are for personal use, lacking real-time feedback to coaches.

---

## Design
Our aim is to provide gym coaches with user vital signs including heartbeats and medical history so that coaches will be able to react to potentially dangerous situations caused by over-reaching cardio exercise in real-time.
Gym coaches are able to see multi-user real-time heart beat rate, heart beat variability, medical history, and heart data analysis through the Hololens.

### Features
- Hololens Features: 
  * Recognize the Server IP using QRCode
  * Identify different users using Vuforia image recognition
  * Locate different users position using Vuforia image localization
  * Receive the HR&HRV data from Server in real-time
  * Receive the data analysis result from Server
  * Receive the medical history from Server
  * Display the data based on the image localization
  * Display menu UI and back UI
